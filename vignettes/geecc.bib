abstract ={Motivation: Functional analyses based on the association of Gene Ontology (GO) terms to genes in a selected gene list are useful bioinformatic tools and the GOstats package has been widely used to perform such computations. In this paper we report significant improvements and extensions such as support for conditional testing.Results: We discuss the capabilities of GOstats, a Bioconductor package written in R, that allows users to test GO terms for over or under-representation using either a classical hypergeometric test or a conditional hypergeometric that uses the relationships among GO terms to decorrelate the results.Availability: GOstats is available as an R package from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.orgContact:sfalcon@fhcrc.org},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep sequencing for transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) in mammals. As RNA-seq becomes more affordable, whole genome transcriptional profiling is likely to become the platform of choice for species with good genomic sequences. As yet, a rigorous analysis methodology has not been developed and we are still in the stages of exploring the features of the data.RESULTS:We investigated the effect of transcript length bias in RNA-seq data using three different published data sets. For standard analyses using aggregated tag counts for each gene, the ability to call differentially expressed genes between samples is strongly associated with the length of the transcript.CONCLUSION:Transcript length bias for calling differentially expressed genes is a general feature of current protocols for RNA-seq technology. This has implications for the ranking of differentially expressed genes, and in particular may introduce bias in gene set testing for pathway analysis and other multi-gene systems biology analyses.REVIEWERS:This article was reviewed by Rohan Williams (nominated by Gavin Huttley), Nicole Cloonan (nominated by Mark Ragan) and James Bullard (nominated by Sandrine Dudoit).},
